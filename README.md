# 🗂 File Organizer Script – Bash + Linux

A simple yet powerful **Bash script** that organizes files in a directory based on their type — because a cluttered workspace isn’t DevOps-approved 😌💻

## 📌 What It Does

This script:

- Organizes files in the current directory
- Groups them into folders like `Documents`, `Images`, `Music`, `Videos`, and `Others`
- Automatically creates folders if they don’t exist
- Logs everything neatly in a `.log` file for reference
